# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Add your user, start a game, make a selection and wait for another player to show up 

Only 2 users can play the game at a time.

Reloading or closing the app web page after starting the game will end the game and delete the user from firebase batabase.

Using Chat section, users can communicate with each other


TODO: add proper notification a user when another user exits the game, currently the section of exited user jusb blanks no message. Create game rooms, so more then 2 users can use the app at the same time
